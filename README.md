Imgurian Tweaks is a chrome extension that adds features to imgur.com. Think of it as the Reddit Enhancement Suite but for Imgur! You can [download it on the chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imgurian-tweaks/hljlokiakakknbbkpcoaceibkjmffnkp?hl=en).

Imgurian Tweaks currently does the following:
* Change the loading gif
* Add the original ratings bar (upvote/downvote bar)
* Get notified of any imgur notifications
* Remove the side gallery

* Add a "YOU" tag to comments that you write
* Add a "STAFF" tag to comments that imgur employees write
* Send people nice messages (via the spread the love feature)
